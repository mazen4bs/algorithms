# Task 7
A computer game has a shooter and a moving target. The shooter can hit any of n > 1 hiding spot located along a
straight line in which the target can hide. The shooter can never see the target; all he knows is that the target moves
to an adjacent hiding spot between every two consecutive shots. Design a Dynamic Programing algorithm that
guarantees hitting the target.
