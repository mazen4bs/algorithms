# Task 1
Devise an algorithm for the following task: given a 2n × 2n
(n > 1) board with one missing square, tile it with right
trominoes of only three colors so that no pair of trominoes that share an edge have the same color. Recall that the
right tromino is an L-shaped tile formed by three adjacent squares.
Use dynamic programing to solve this problem.
# Task 2
Is it possible for a chess knight to visit all the cells of an 8 × 8 chessboard exactly once, ending at a cell one knight’s
move away from the starting cell? (Such a tour is called closed or re-entrant. Note that a cell is considered visited only
when the knight lands on it, not just passes over it on its move.)
If it is possible design a greedy algorithm to find the minimum number of moves the chess knight needs
# Task 7
A computer game has a shooter and a moving target. The shooter can hit any of n > 1 hiding spot located along a
straight line in which the target can hide. The shooter can never see the target; all he knows is that the target moves
to an adjacent hiding spot between every two consecutive shots. Design a Dynamic Programing algorithm that
guarantees hitting the target.
